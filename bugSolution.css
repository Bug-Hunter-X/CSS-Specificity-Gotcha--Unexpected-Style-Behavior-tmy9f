The solution involves a deeper understanding of CSS specificity:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special div {
  color: red; /* Still less specific */
}

#myDiv {
  color: green; /* More specific due to ID selector */
}

/* Solution: Use a more specific selector to override. 
   For instance: make the special div's more specific by adding an ID to it or by adding an additional class*/
#specialDiv {
  color: red; /* This will override the div style */
}
```

In this improved solution, the id selector `#specialDiv` is used to achieve the desired color change.  This demonstrates the correct way to override styles based on CSS specificity rules.  Other solutions could involve making the selector more specific.
