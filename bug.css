The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special div {
  color: red; /* This will not override the color of the parent div */
}

#myDiv {
  color: green; /* This will override the color of the parent div */
}
```

The issue is that the class selector `.special div` is less specific than the ID selector `#myDiv`. Even though `.special div` is more targeted, it does not override the parent's style because of the specificity rules.
